## How It Works

Each CVE is scored by pulling live data from:

| Source | Provider | What it tells you |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| **CVSS v3.1** | NVD | Base severity (0–10) |
| **EPSS** | FIRST | Probability of exploitation in the wild |
| **KEV (Confirmed)** | CISA | Confirmed active exploitation |
| **KEV (Early signal)** | VulnCheck | Earlier exploitation evidence before CISA inclusion |
| **GitHub PoCs** | GitHub API | Public proof-of-concept code exists |
| **ExploitDB / MSF** | ExploitDB CSV + Metasploit Framework | Working exploit / Metasploit module exists |
| **OSV fallback** | OSV.dev | Metadata/CVSS fallback when NVD is missing or delayed |

Scores are combined using a weighted risk blend with KEV signal weighting and a CISA-confirmed critical floor, normalized to 0–100.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stov3/fluescan.git
cd fluescan
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Dependencies:** `pyfiglet` (optional — ASCII art title; graceful fallback if missing).  
> All API calls use Python's standard library (`urllib`).

## Quick Start

```bash
# Single CVE
python3 fluescan.py CVE-2024-1234

# Multiple CVEs — sorted by priority, highest risk first
python3 fluescan.py CVE-2024-1234 CVE-2023-44487 CVE-2022-0847

# Multiple CVEs (comma-separated also supported)
python3 fluescan.py CVE-2024-1234, CVE-2023-44487, CVE-2022-0847
# From a file (one CVE per line, # = comment)
python3 fluescan.py --cves-file examples/sample_cves.txt

# Export reports
python3 fluescan.py --cves-file my_cves.txt \
  --output-json report.json \
  --output-csv  report.csv

# No console table (useful for scripting / piping)
python3 fluescan.py CVE-2024-1234 --no-table

# Concise per-CVE score explanations
python3 fluescan.py --cves-file examples/sample_cves.txt --explain

# Interactive guided menu (no arguments)
python3 fluescan.py

# Diagnostics
python3 fluescan.py --check-apis   # test all API connections
python3 fluescan.py --setup        # configure API keys interactively
```
`--explain` prints a concise deterministic explanation per CVE with an `affected:` component line plus a one-paragraph score rationale.

## Scoring Algorithm

The priority score uses a **weighted risk blend with exploitation override** to keep scoring transparent and practical.
### Scoring Formula

```
raw_score = (0.30 × cvss_norm)
          + (0.40 × epss_norm)
          + (0.20 × kev_strength)
          + (0.10 × exploit_norm)

priority_score = raw_score × 100 × evidence_factor × exposure_weight

if cisa_kev_confirmed:
    priority_score = max(priority_score, 85)
```

### Normalization Rules
- **kev_strength**:
  - `1.0` = in CISA KEV (confirmed exploitation)
  - `0.4` = VulnCheck-only KEV early signal (reduced confidence weight)
  - `0.0` = no KEV signal
- **exploit_norm**:
  - `0.0` = no exploit signal
  - `0.5` = GitHub PoC only
  - `1.0` = Metasploit module present (with or without PoC)
- **exposure_weight** (from CVSS `AV:` soft signal):
  - `1.07` = `AV:N` (network reachable)
  - `1.03` = `AV:A` (adjacent network)
  - `0.96` = `AV:L` (local)
  - `0.90` = `AV:P` (physical)
  - `1.00` = unknown/unavailable

### Evidence Factor

Less (or weaker) evidence lowers the score. Each CVE's evidence confidence (see below) is converted into a smooth multiplier:

```
evidence_factor = min(1.0, confidence / 85)
```

In practice:
- Full trust (factor 1.0) at confidence ≥ 85 — well-documented CVEs are not penalized
- Below that, the penalty grows proportionally (e.g. confidence 57 → ×0.67)
- CVSS from OSV fallback, missing EPSS, or failed API lookups all reduce the factor
- The CISA KEV critical floor (85) still applies regardless — confirmed exploitation is a hard fact

### Worked Example

```
CVE-2023-44487 (HTTP/2 Rapid Reset DoS):

Input:
  CVSS = 7.5
  EPSS = 1.00
  CISA KEV = YES
  VulnCheck KEV = YES
  PoC = YES
  Metasploit = YES

Normalize:
  cvss_norm = 7.5 / 10 = 0.75
  epss_norm = 1.00
  kev_strength = 1.0
  exploit_norm = 1.0
Evidence:
  evidence_factor = 1.0   # confidence ≥ 85, full trust
  score = 0.925 × 100 × 1.0 × 1.07 = 98.975

Critical override (CISA-confirmed only):
  score = max(98.975, 85) = 98.975
```

### Risk Level Interpretation

| Score Range | Risk Level | Interpretation |
| 0–29 | **Minimal** | Very low risk; low severity and no evidence of exploitation |

### Design Rationale

- Linear blending is easy to audit and explain to operators.
- EPSS includes optional 7-day delta enrichment for trend-aware triage.
- Missing data is handled transparently by the evidence factor instead of synthetic priors.

### Confidence & Evidence Scoring

Fluescan outputs a **single priority score** — exploitability signals (KEV, EPSS, PoC, Metasploit) are already blended into it. Each CVE's **evidence confidence (0–100%)** is computed from source authority and health, then folded into the score via the `evidence_factor`: less or weaker evidence means a lower score.

```
confidence = (28 × cvss_quality) + (24 × epss_quality)
           + (20 × kev_quality)  + (28 × exploit_intel_quality)
           ± agreement adjustment
```

- **Source quality** distinguishes authority: NVD CVSS (0.92) > OSV fallback (0.75) > missing (0.30); a verified "not in EPSS" (0.45) is better evidence than a failed lookup (0.25).
- **Errors ≠ absence**: a failed API check lowers confidence more than a verified negative result.
- **Agreement adjustment**: +4 when ≥3 independent sources corroborate exploitation; −5 when signals conflict (critical CVSS but very weak exploitation evidence).
- Levels: `HIGH` ≥ 85, `MEDIUM` 65–84, `LOW` < 65 (verify manually).
- Each CVE's `--explain` output includes an `affected:` component label (product/service orientation) and a concise paragraph covering score drivers (KEV, EPSS, exploit artifacts, CVSS), attack-vector exposure, floor application, and any evidence dampening.
- `affected_component` and `explain_summary` are exported in JSON/CSV for triage and ownership workflows.

## Console Output

Results are **sorted by priority** (highest first) and colour-coded.
Console output now shows the prioritized table and completion line only.

```
Rank   CVE ID             Priority    CVSS   Severity   EPSS   AV   ExpW    KEV    PoC   Multiplier
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
1      CVE-2023-44487     98.97       7.5    HIGH       1.00   N    1.07x   YES    YES   1.38x
2      CVE-2020-1472      85.00       5.5    MEDIUM     1.00   L    0.96x   YES    YES   1.38x
3      CVE-2024-50379     55.50       9.8    CRITICAL   0.44   N    1.07x   NO     YES   1.20x
```

- `KEV` values are explicit: `YES` (CISA confirmed), `EARLY` (VulnCheck-only), `NO` (no KEV signal).
- `AV` and `ExpW` show CVSS attack vector and the soft exposure weight used in scoring.

| Colour | Score | Action |
|--------|-------|--------|
| 🟣 Bright Purple | ≥ 80 | Patch immediately |
| 🔴 Red | ≥ 60 | Patch soon |
| 🟠 Amber | ≥ 40 | Patch this month |
| 🟡 Yellow | ≥ 20 | Patch when possible |
| 🟢 Green | < 20 | Low priority |

## Rate Limits

All data sources are fetched in **parallel batches** (EPSS and KEV feeds are single batched downloads; per-CVE lookups run concurrently per source), so total fetch time is bounded by the slowest source instead of the sum of all of them.

The tool enforces per-API rate limits automatically. When a limit is reached it displays an in-place countdown and resumes without data loss. Local result caches (24h TTL) mean re-runs of recently analyzed CVEs cost **zero** API calls.

| API | Unauthenticated | With key/token | Local cache |
|-----|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| NVD (CVSS) | 5 req/min | 5 req/sec (×60) | 24h per-CVE result cache |
| EPSS (+ trend) | 30 req/min (batch) | — | — |
| CISA KEV | One request (cached with `If-Modified-Since`) | — | Conditional cache |
| VulnCheck KEV | — | 60 req/min (token) | 6h cache |
| OSV fallback | 60 req/min | — | — |
| GitHub Search | 10 req/min (1 query/CVE) | 30 req/min (1 query/CVE) | 24h per-CVE result cache + ETag |
| ExploitDB CSV | One download (ETag-cached, free on re-runs) | — | ETag cache |

---

## Optional API Keys

None are required, but they speed things up significantly for large batches.

### NVD API Key — 60× faster CVSS lookups

```bash
# Get a free key: https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key
export NVD_API_KEY=your_key_here
# or add to .env (see .env.example)
```

### GitHub Token — 3× more GitHub searches + MSF module detection

```bash
# Create at https://github.com/settings/tokens
# No scopes needed for public data access
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
```

### VulnCheck Token — early KEV signal coverage

```bash
# Free community signup
export VULNCHECK_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

This token is optional. If not configured, the tool still runs normally using CISA KEV and other sources.

With a GitHub token, the tool also searches the official
[`rapid7/metasploit-framework`](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework)
repository for modules referencing the CVE — the most accurate source for MSF coverage.

### Interactive setup

```bash
python3 fluescan.py --setup
```

Keys are saved to `.env` (already in `.gitignore`).
